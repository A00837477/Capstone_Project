# My name is Javier Cruz Villarreal, a 1st semester University student at ITESM
# This is my final programming project for my class, where i will be making a special game based on a 6x6 board


#Function that makes the matrix
mat=[["   " , " 0 " , " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " , " 4 " , " 5 "],
     [" 0 " , " * " , " _ " , " X " , " X " , " _ " , " * "],
     [" 1 " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ "],
     [" 2 " , " _ " , " _ " , " = " , " = " , " _ " , " _ "],
     [" 3 " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ "],
     [" 4 " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ " , " _ "],
     [" 5 " , " * " , " _ " , " O " , " O " , " _ " , " * "]]
#while that keeps the game running until someone wins or loses

#main function
